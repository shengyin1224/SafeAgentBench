# SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents

With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to execute complicated instructions in natural language, paving a way for the potential deployment of embodied robots. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present **SafeAgentBench** â€”- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks.

## Quickstart

Clone repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shengyin/safeagentbench.git 
$ cd safeagentbench
```

Install requirements:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## More Info 

- [**Dataset**](dataset/): Safe detailed tasks(300 samples), unsafe detailed tasks(300 samples), abstract tasks(100 samples) and long-horizon tasks(50 samples).
- [**Evaluators**](evaluator/): Evaluation metrics for each type of task, including success rate, rejection rate, and other metrics.
- [**low-level controller**](low_level_controller/): A low-level controller for SafeAgentEnv, which takes in the high-level action and map them to low-level actions supported by AI2-THOR for the agent to execute. You can choose multi-agent version or single-agent version. 

## SOTA Embodied LLM Agents

Because each agent has different code structure, we can not provide all the implementation codes. You can refer to these works' papers and codes to implement your own agent.
